### Code Coverage
To set up code coverage for this project. Login into [Codecov][codecov] and add this repository from your list of tracked repos.

### Setup Documentation

If you don't have a `docs/Reloaded` folder, you might need to add it manually as submodule:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded.MkDocsMaterial.Themes.R2.git docs/Reloaded
```

After which you can follow the [Theme Documentation](https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded.MkDocsMaterial.Themes.R2/Pages/contributing.html#website-live-preview) to find out how to work with the docs.

Before you make your first commit to GitHub, you'll need to go to `Settings -> Pages` and set
`Source` to `GitHub Actions` for the documentation builds to work.


### Setup API Key (crates.io)

You'll need to set up an API key to publish to `crates.io` on tag.

- Go to `Settings -> Secrets -> Actions` in your repo and add environment secret named `CRATES_IO_TOKEN`.  
- Paste your API key generated in [crates.io (Account Settings -> API Tokens)][crates-io-key].
